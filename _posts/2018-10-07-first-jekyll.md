This is just a sample post to see what Jekyll is all about. I almost didn't do this, because I instantly wanted to create workaround for the date-url part.
However, I'm glad I stuck with this, because seeing each of these parts through is useful for learning.
I'm not sure if I'll use posts very much--I'll probably go with collections, or use permalinks to fix the date-url path a user might see.
